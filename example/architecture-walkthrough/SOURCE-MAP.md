# Find the real implementation

Paths are relative to the named source repository. The displayed code is extracted from these functions, not pseudocode. Values such as glow/shadow are illustrative authored content. `prepare.mjs` executes the installed model and saves the actual inputs, frames and object identities in `execution.json`.

| Repository / file | Function and responsibility | Concrete boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| agentic-report / src/composition.ts | compositionFrame(ids, cues, time, resolve) | Fresh Map of object states; timed connections/travels; no DOM or writes to input cues |
| agentic-report / src/composition.ts | compositionTime(anchor, starts, end) | Standalone anchor resolution; three-second preview convention when starts is absent |
| agentic-report / src/browser/features/composition.ts | cuesOf, installComposition, render(time) | Reads compiled cue attributes/templates; invokes model; updates actual DOM and SVG |
| agentic-report / src/browser/features/composition.ts | content, scopedClone | Clones original DOM bodies, keeps destination title and scopes copied local references |
| agentic-report / src/composition-route.ts | connectionRoute(a, b, obstacles) | Live boundary ports and rounded obstacle routes in stage CSS pixels |
| agentic-report / src/browser/technique-timing.ts | timed(render) | Subscribes render to page clock, passes milliseconds, requests further real frames while active |
| agentic-report / src/browser/clock.ts | createClock, pageClock | Manual seek notifies subscribers; external mode plugs into Screencast renderAt; real mode runs browser time |
| agentic-screencast / src/report-composition.ts | installReportComposition | On stage mount, maps cue anchors to measured starts/ends and calls control.bind(resolve) |

For `copy`, the model's destination `content` refers to the source content descriptor; it is not a deep-cloned business value. The browser separately clones the referenced template into the destination DOM body. After `replace @ 3s`, `compositionFrame(..., 4)` returns `shape.content = {text: "Shadow 12 px"}`. A fresh call at 0 returns `{source: "shape"}`, a different Map and no travel. In a film, beat anchors use measured narration instead of these illustrative numeric times.

The resize listener and the clock both lead to the same browser render. `rect()` reads the current geometry after content/entrance changes; connections are not cached in obsolete screen coordinates. Adding a model action belongs in composition.ts and its source contract; changing its picture belongs in the browser renderer; changing speech binding belongs in Screencast's bridge. Printing and reduced motion render final static state.
